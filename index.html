          Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles,
          California in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass,
          who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The
          duo's name is derived from "tenacious defense", a phrase used by NBA
          basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert.

          Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album Tenacious D,
          the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO, with the
          episodes broadcasting between 1997 and 2000. This series came about
          after the band had met David Cross on the Los Angeles music scene—and
          Black featuring in episodes of Mr. Show with Bob and David. The band
          also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, which began a
          working relationship between Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the
          end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer,
          Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.

          In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after released
          Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl
          on the drums. Their first single, "Tribute", has achieved cult status
          since its release, contributing to their popularity in the United
          Kingdom, Sweden, Ireland and Australia. In 2003, the band released The
          Complete Master Works, their first live concert DVD which achieved
          gold and platinum status by the RIAA.

          In November 2006, they starred in their own film, Tenacious D in The
          Pick of Destiny, released by New Line Cinema, with Epic Records
          releasing the soundtrack as their second album, The Pick of Destiny.
          The film cost $20 million to produce, though only grossed $13.9
          million at the box office and suffered mixed reviews from critics.
          Despite the poor reception of the actual film, the band would near
          sell-out arenas on its respective tour, including Madison Square
          Garden in New York. Following several years of sporadic festival dates
          and special appearances, the band released their third album Rize of
          the Fenix on May 15, 2012, through Columbia Records, with the album
          making light of The Pick of Destiny's commercial failure.

          In 2013, the band hosted the comedy music festival Festival Supreme in
          Los Angeles, which would go on to host three more editions. In 2014,
          the band were invited to feature on Ronnie James Dio – This Is Your
          Life, a compilation album where various artists cover Ronnie James Dio
          songs to raise funds for cancer. Their cover of "The Last in Line" won
          a Grammy for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy
          Awards. Following teases from Black and Gass regarding a second film,
          in late 2018, the band began independently releasing an animatic
          hand-drawn web series titled, Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto, each of
          the six episodes uploading exclusively to YouTube every week starting
          September 28. Columbia Records released the album Post-Apocalypto on
          November 2, 2018, just after the release of the sixth episode.

          Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and
          Gass's acoustic guitar-playing abilities. Critics have described their
          fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock".
          Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as
          well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music
          critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.
